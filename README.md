# GavaniaPrequalTrilogy
3 in 1 package of the Prequal games of the first main line Gavania video game, prototyped, and initially made in the RPG Maker MZ engine.

Mages of Gavania is the newest game in the Gavania franchise, and takes place about the same time as Hunters of Gavania. The main character, Maryhyme, and her life long best friend, Psymentus, attend the famed University of Shearmagnus, where mages learn to do magic, among other things. As a high school type of simulator, you get to hang out with friends, do various activities, explore the surrounding areas, and unlock the dark secrets of the University, while having to keep on studying to pass the various tests to stay attended in the university. Every once in a while, mandatory trips to places take place, where a lot of the main story events take place. The game's events are based on a 28 day per month calender, where certain things are availible and unavailable on certain days, and during certain hours of the day. The player is able to learn nearly any spell in the game via studdying them in various ways by giving each skill "learned exp", and when it maxes, they learn it and keep it permanently. The 40+ recruitable students in the game each have their own stat multipliers, move pools, and various different and/or unique traits.
